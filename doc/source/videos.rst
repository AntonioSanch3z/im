IM Videos
=========

There are an Infrastructure Manager youtube channel with a set of videos with demos
of the functionality of the platform.

Currently there are tree videos available, but soon more videos will be uploaded:

The first one shows how to use the IM web interface to launch a Hadoop Cluster with a 
single click in a OpenNebula on-premise cloud platform and in Amazon EC2.

The second video shows a demo of how to create a cluster with a single click using the 
IM web interface with the EC3 tool. It also shows how CLUES works to dinamically manage 
the size of the cluster automatically.

The third one shows how to use the IM web interface to access `EGI FedCloud <http://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/>`_
 sites using the OCCI plugin, showing also how to launch a Hadoop Cluster with a single click.
