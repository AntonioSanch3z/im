About IM
========

Cloud infrastructures are becoming an appropriate solution to address the
computational needs of scientific applications. However, the use of public or
on-premises Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds require users to have
non-trivial system administration skills.

For that, IM is a **tool that ease the access and the usability of IaaS
clouds** by automating the VMI selection, deployment, configuration, software
installation, monitoring and update of Virtual Appliances. **It supports APIs
from a large number of virtual platforms**, making user applications
cloud-agnostic. In addition **it integrates a contextualization system** to
enable the installation and configuration of all the user required applications
providing the user with a fully functional infrastructure.

It is a service that features a **web-based GUI, a XML-RPC API, a REST API and
a command-line application**.
